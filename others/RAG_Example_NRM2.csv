The demand for each style is independent. The store’s objective is to maximize the total expected revenue based on the fixed initial inventories of the Nike x Olivia Kim brand, which are detailed in column “inventory.” During the sales horizon, no replenishment is allowed, and there are no in-transit inventories. Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column “demand.” Moreover, the trade will be started only when the total demand is no less than 100 to ensure the trading efficiency. The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.
