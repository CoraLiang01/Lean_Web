"Based on all flight ticket choices in 'flight.csv' and 'od_demand.csv' with attraction values in v1 and shadow attraction value ratios in v2, develop the SBLP(sales-based linear programming) formulation for among flights (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='23:00'), (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='19:05'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='15:40'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='18:50'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='16:55'),  that maximize the total revenue of flight ticket sales. The SBLP should include decision variables, objective function, balance constraints, scale constraints, nonnegative constraints and selection constraints. Please consider that each Eco_flex ticket consumes 2.1 units of flight capacity and each Eco_lite ticket consumes 1 unit of capacity.",
