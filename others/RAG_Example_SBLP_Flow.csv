"Based on flight ticket options provided in the table, along with their average passengers (Avg Pax), average prices (Avg Price), and capacity coefficients (Flex Cpy Coef), considering that each Eco_flex ticket consumes 2.4 units of flight capacity and each Eco_lite ticket consumes 1 unit of capacity, while enforcing flow conservation constraints at each airport for long-term planning model, develop a Sales-Based Linear Programming (SBLP) model. 

The goal of this model is to recommend the optimal 4 flights that maximize total ticket sale revenue, specifically among flights where the origin-destination pairs are: 
OD = ('A', 'B') or OD = ('A', 'C') or OD = ('B', 'A') or ('C', 'A') in a departure period (07:00-12:00) in which the optional flights are: 
(OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='11:20'), (OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='07:55'), (OD = ('A', 'C') AND Departure Time='09:45'), (OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='09:05'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='07:40'), (OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='08:15').",
