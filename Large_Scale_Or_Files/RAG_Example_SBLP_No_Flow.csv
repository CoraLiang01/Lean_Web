"Based on flight ticket options provided in './Test_Dataset/Air_NRM/information.csv', along with their associated attraction values (v1) and shadow attraction value ratios (v2), develop a Sales-Based Linear Programming (SBLP) model. The goal of this model is to recommend the optimal 3 flights that maximize total ticket sale revenue, specifically among flights with an origin-destination: OD = ('A', 'B') and a departure period (11am-1pm) in which the flights are: [(OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='11:20'), (OD = ('A', 'B') AND Departure Time='12:40')]"
