"In the Superstore chain, multiple branches require inventory replenishment, and several suppliers located in different cities can provide the necessary goods. Each supplier incurs a fixed cost upon starting operations, with the fixed cost data provided in the “fixed_costs.csv” file. Each branch needs to source a certain quantity of goods from these suppliers. For each branch, the transportation cost per unit of goods from each supplier is recorded in the “transportation_costs.csv” file. Demand information can be gained in 'demand.csv'. The objective is to determine which suppliers to activate so that the demand of all branches is met while minimizing the total cost.","Large_Scale_Or_Files/UFLP_example/demand.csv
