"Walmart stores play a critical role in supplying essential goods to various customer groups on a daily basis. The problem involves determining the optimal transportation plan that satisfies the demands of 4 customer groups, whose daily demand data is provided in ""customer_demands.csv"". These demands must be met using supplies from 3 Walmart stores, each with a specific daily supply capacity detailed in ""supply_capacity.csv"". The transportation cost per unit of goods from each Walmart store to each customer group is recorded in ""transportation_costs.csv"". The objective is to determine the quantity of goods transported from each Walmart store to each customer group, ensuring that all demands are met without exceeding the supply capacity of any store, while minimizing the total transportation cost.","Large_Scale_Or_Files/TP_example/customer_demand.csv
